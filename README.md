# flight-altitude
Uses a combination of R and ArcPro to clean PinPoint-collected altitude measurements and convert them to height-above-terrain. Ideally this would be converted to ArcPy at some point so that it's easily repeatable for new locations, which will be especially important after I graduate. Watch this space.

Eventually will also include a Bayesian analysis to deconflate measurement error and a hidden movement state (ground/flight), allowing us to estimate the true distribution of flight altitudes. Intended to be one of my chapters.
