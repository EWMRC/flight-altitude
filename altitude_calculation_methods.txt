Project a csv as a 3D shapefile in Arc (altitude_locs_3D.shp)
Convert the projection to Horizontal: NAD 1983 (2011) Vertical: NAVD88 (height) (ftUS) (altitude_locs_3D_geoid.shp)
Use Add XY Coordinates to include a field with transformed Z coordinates
Calculate a new column (elev_geoid) that converts ft to m by multiplying the Z field by 0.3048
Use extract values to points to extract the terrain height from the raster mosaic in elev.gdb (altitude_locs_3D_geoid_terrain_height.shp)
Calculate a new field (alt_hat) that is elev_geoid - RASTERVALU
Read into R and analyse
