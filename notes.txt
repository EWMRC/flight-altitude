Look at flight altitude as a function of distance to coast?
Altitude as a function of length of migratory step? Shouldn't be hard to calculate

Alternatively- view as a species-specific look at how a relatively small
migrant selects aerospace habitat
What heights do they select relative to the mean? How well do they utilize
the dominant wind? What does this suggest for their susceptibility to
buildling collisions?

Are these birds regularly flying lower than the flight heights reported via radar?
	Calculate the percentage of these locations that fall below the minimum
	threshold in Horton et al. 2016 (155m)
	31.4% of locations below the minimum observation from radar (CI: 0.3052, 0.3234)
	
	Mode is rather low (56m); are we concerned?
